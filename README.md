The MediaPlay Metaverse

---

The plan is to use the Matrix protocol as well, but right now it's still nothing.

# Why [Matrix](https://matrix.org)?
Metaverses definitely need to be open-source, decentralized, federated, and interoperatable with other metaverses as well, so that's why it will use Matrix for most of the federation, interoperability, you know, the stuff that make metaverses work.

Though on how it works using the Matrix protocol, it's another story, the MediaPlay metaverse is focused on building the worlds for now.

# Matrix homeserver?
It's nice if we have some resources to set up our own Matrix homeserver, but for now it should work with a public Matrix homeserver. Just make an account and an unencrypted room and it'll work just fine. If you want end-to-end encryption (which isn't really practical for now, except for secret chats), you can use [Pantalaimon](https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon).

# Why use Godot for the client?
Some people used Godot as well to make simple games with the Matrix protocol, so why not?

# What platforms will it support? Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, Android, iOS, HTML5?
Godot supports those platforms, but I will be exporting it for Windows, GNU/Linux, Android, and HTML5 for now. Feel free to clone the repository and export it yourself for the platform you want.

Web 3.0 will definitely come soon. Not sure if the metaverse is (really) the future of the internet or is just a hype.
